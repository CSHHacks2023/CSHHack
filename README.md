*Virtual Assistant!
*USer speaks into microphone, the text shows up on the screen in the bottom of the window
*The virtual assistant will recognize the question and then provide an answer
*Shown on the screen there is an animated image that will 'talk' back to the user to provide advice
*There may be more than one assistant that is be available to the user
    *Environmental tips and tricks, health advice and diagnosis, GEICO insurance questions
*The purpose is to have a casual conversation that is organic and not scripted or unuseful like other virtual assistants/chatbots
